#### Episode 1: From small beginnings come great things

The purpose of this repository is to be a recording of progress. A clear indicator of how far I've come as a programmer and how much further I can get.
Mainly, this repository contains implementations of various data structures and their respective algorithms. Alongside this code are solutions to various interview-grade problems found online.

And I'm off.

#### Episode 2: Cracking it

Seems that Cracking the Coding Interview is my best path to polishing my interviewing skills. So that's my next stop. I'll try to answer all the technical questions and cover them with tests.

Meanwhile, finding the energy to create and commit anything of substance in this repository after work is proving to be really difficult. I hope I can maintain any sense of regular activity.
